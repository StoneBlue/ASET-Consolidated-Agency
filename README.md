KSP 1.12.x 
Near Future Propulsion [1.3.5] 
Last Updated August 26, 2021 

This pack contains advanced electric engines for deep space travel. Generally engines split into the following categories: 
    • Gridded Ion Engines: like the stock Dawn, they have low TWR and great Isp. They run on Xenon fuel. 
    • Hall Effect Thrusters: similar to Gridded thrusters, but with better TWR at the cost of some Isp. They run on Argon fuel and are pretty cheap! 
    • Magnetoplasmadynamic Thrusters: with the best TWR of all electric engines, these engines are very power-hungry. They run on Lithium fuel. 
    • Pulsed Inductive Thrusters: similar to Hall thrusters, they run on Argon fuel and have the unique ability to dump extra electricity into the engine, increasing Isp but generating more heat.  
    • VASIMR Engines: high tech and fancy, these engines run on either Xenon or Argon fuel. They can be tuned for high-thrust, low Isp operation, or low-thrust, high-Isp operation 
These engines are all very power hungry - use nuclear reactors or high intensity solar to get the power you need. Their balance has been finely tuned to work with stock mechanics and to extend the KSP experience, particularly in combination with the Community Tech Tree.

Frequently Asked Questions 
Q: Will you add a part I want?
A: I have defined this mod as feature complete, and bugfixes are all I plan to add. 
Q: The mod album shows parts that look old/don't exist. What's up with that?
A: Keeping the gallery up to date is not super easy. I have it as an action item in the future but this takes time away from real modding. 
Q: Does this work well with KSPI-E?
A: Talk to FreeThinker about this, he manages KSPI-E and its compatibility with NFT

Near Future Electrical [1.2.3] 
Last Updated July 21, 2021 

Ever wanted some futuristic energy generation that wasn't too... futuristic? I have you covered here. This pack contains: 
    • Nuclear Reactors: Turn Uranium into power! Attach nuclear reactors to your vessel and generate large amount of electricity. Ensure that you have enough cooling capacity with radiators for your reactors to work properly.   
    • Refuelling Parts: store extra uranium, reprocess it and extract it from Ore with containers and reprocessors. 
    • Capacitors: discharge for a burst of power! These parts can be charge up with normal generating capacity, and once activated will deliver a large amount of power to your ship's electricity banks. Very mass efficient!

A: I have defined this mod as feature complete, and bugfixes are all I plan to add. 
Q: I'm using Remote Tech and something doesn't work!
A: This mod is not compatible with RemoteTech. Some aspects may work but the reflector/feeder system would need to be reimplemented by the RT devs.

A: I have defined this mod as feature complete, and bugfixes are all I plan to add. 
Q: I don't like the balance of *thisPart*
A: I appreciate suggestions from experience aeronauts for engine balance, it's not really my specialty (Sith lords are).

Special Thanks  
A big hand to @Streetwind , who basically designed the balance for the whole NFT suite.
