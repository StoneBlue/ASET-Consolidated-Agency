## ASET Consolidated Avionics Pack

A props pack consisting of mostly Aircraft-style controls, instruments & gauges, both "modern" & "classic" in style.
Note that this pack does nothing on its own, as it is just a pack of assets, and *requires* the installation of a seperate "IVA mod" which utilizes it.
